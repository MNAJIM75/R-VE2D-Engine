THIS PROJECT IS AIMED TO MAKE A LOVE2D ONLY LIKE API BY THE
USING OF THE RAYLIB-LUA BINDINGS (RAYLUA)

PROJECT INFO:-
    NAME: rove2D
    VERSION : 0.0
    DEVELOPER: ALMOTHANA

PROJECT DESCRIBTION:
    FIRST I NEED TO MAKE THE API HAVE SOME BACKEND TO DO ALL
    THE WORK FOR ME. LIKE INSTED OF ME MAKING EACH COMPONENT
    AS TABLE, I'M GOING TO MAKE THEM AS MODULES WHERE THE
    ENGINE WILL RUN A SET OF FUNCTIONS AUTOMATIC.
    LIKE:
        init() ; update(_dt) ; preDeInit() ; deInit()
    THESE WILL BE EXCUTED BY THE ENGINE ON THERE OWN

    THE ENGINE WILL ALSO TAKE A FUNCTIONS FROM THE DEVELOPER
    AND EXCUTED THEM. LIKE:
        rove.load(args) ; rove.update(_dt) ; rove.draw() ;
        rove.mousepressed(_x, _y, _b) ... etc
            THE SAME AS LOVE2D API SCRIPTED FUNCTIONS
    
    WHAT WILL BE INTEGRATED:
        - MODULES TYPE: THE CLASS/TYPE THAT WILL BE THE BASE
            FOR ALL THE INTEGRATED API LIBRARIES
        - MODULES SYSTEM/SCENE : THE SYSTEM WHERE THE MODULES
            EXCUTION DONE IN THE GAME LOOP
        - GRAPHICS: FOR GRAPHIC ACCESS
        - AUDIO: PLAY, PAUSE, OR STOP ALMOST ANY SOUND
        - MOUSE: MOUSE AND THE BUTTONS AND SOME TOUCH FEATURES
        - KEYBOARD: ALMOST ALL THE KEYBOARD INPUT KEYS
        - EVENT SYSTEM: THE SYSTEM IS MADE FOR SOME INGAME
            RUN EVENT FOR THE rove-ENGINE NOT THE GAME RUNNING
        
THROUGH THE USE OF THIS METHOD I CAN SAPERATE THE rove-ENGINE
FROM THE SUN-ENGINE AS WHEN DEVELOPING COMPLETE OR SEMI-COMP
THE rove-ENGINE CAN BE INTEGRATED INTO THE RAYLIB-LUAJIT
COMPILER THEN CREATING A BATCH FILE THAT WILL RUN THE GIVEN
DIRECTOY main.lua FILE
LIKE:

rove.bat:
@EACH OFF
%rayjit% rove main.lua conf.lua
@ECHO ON
